# Instruments

I want to simulate physical instruments here rather than generate signals digitally directly (digital synths) or simulating analog synths circuits.

To do this i plan on having a large number of physical elements interact with each other.

elements exist in 3d space and are connected to their neighbors.  Each agent/atom/element has a very simple state and its behavior will be deturmined via a tuneable combination of its state and its neighbors states.  The bonds beetween neighbors can have a state too but (hopefully) it would be simpler


Winds are gas/liquids that flow and oscillate through and over pipes like a traditional woodwind

fires are purcusive elements that pop and strike

waters probably dont need to exist but if it did i guess it could do something like: shimmer, reverb, echos, drone, crash regularly, pop and crackle like a creek or stream?
